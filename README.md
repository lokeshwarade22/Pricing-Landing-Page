FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification includes a project called "Build A Product Landing Page." The objective is to create a web application on CodePen.io that mirrors the functionality of the provided example. Your task is to meet specific user stories and ensure that all tests pass. These stories include requirements such as having a header with a designated ID, including an image within the header, having a navigation bar, incorporating clickable elements, embedding a product video, including a form with validation, and ensuring the navbar stays fixed at the top of the viewport. Additionally, the project must utilize CSS flexbox and include at least one media query. Once completed, you'll submit the URL to your project with all tests successfully passing.
